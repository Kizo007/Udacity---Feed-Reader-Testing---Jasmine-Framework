## About the project

In this project we are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds by Udacity. The tests are added using Jasmine to check the functionalites of the code written.

## How To Play

1.Download or clone the repository on your machine.

2.Extract the .zip file

3.Open index.html in your browser


## Why this Project?

Testing is an important part of the development process and many organizations practice a standard of development known as "test-driven development." 
This is when developers write tests first, before they ever start developing their application. 
All the tests initially fail and then they start writing application code to make these tests pass.

Whether you work in an organization that uses test-driven development or in an organization that uses tests to make sure future feature development doesn't break existing features, it's an important skill to have!


## What will I learn?

You will learn how to use Jasmine to write a number of tests against a pre-existing application. 
These will test the underlying business logic of the application as well as the event handling and DOM manipulation.


## How to run the application?

In order to run the Feed Reader just clone/download the repository then open index.html.



## Contributing

This repository is the starter code for _all_ Udacity students. Therefore, we most likely will not accept pull requests.
